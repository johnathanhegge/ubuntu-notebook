<h1>Connecting to the environment</h1>
<p>
    You are executing an ephemeral environment that you can SSH into for
    testing code and mechanisms on an Intel/x86_64 system. <b>Please note that
    anything not saved in <code>/data</code> will be lost when you exit the
    environment!</b>
</p>
To connect, please SSH to:
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>
            &nbsp;Address:&nbsp;<b>%NIMBIXUSER%@%PUBLICADDR%</b><br>
            Password:&nbsp;<b>%NIMBIXPASSWD%</b><br>
        </code></li>
</ul>
<p>
    You will be able to run commands as <code>root</code> using the
    <code>sudo</code> prefix once in.
</p>
<p>
    You may optionally install an SSH public key for password-less access by
    clicking on your username in the top right of the portal, then <i>Account
    Settings</i>, then
    <i>SSH Keys</i> to manage your SSH keys.
